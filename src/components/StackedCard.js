        <p>Pastor M.S. Abraham, born and raised in India as the son of a pioneering missionary pastor, experienced God's calling through numerous miracles during his seminary and secular education.

           In Portland, ME, he joined First Assembly of God, assisting Pastors Hinman and Johnson while earning a Master's Degree in Counseling from the University of Southern Maine. Pastor Abraham became the senior pastor in May 2001, bringing spiritual growth and equipping believers for ministry.
